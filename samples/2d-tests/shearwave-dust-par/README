    succeeds # One of [succeeds|failing since <date>|obsolete| ...]
Recommended resolution:
    None. Varying the resolution is a good test of how many grid points the
    code needs to resolve a self-gravitating shear wave.
Comments:
    Another shear wave test, this time without gravity but with drag force,
    used to test drag force assignment over the shear-periodic boundary.
