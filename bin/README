In October 2002 the files in this directory were

   4 CVS/                4 cvsci_run*      8 mkdotin*      4 run.csh*       4 x*
   4 README              4 getconf.csh     4 mkinpars*     4 setup-src*
   4 adapt-mkfile*       8 gpgrowth*       4 new*          4 start.csh*
   8 auto-test*          4 local*         12 nl2idl*       4 timestr*
   4 cvs-add-rundir*     4 mkcparam*       4 own-risk*     4 tst.csh*

setup-src (formerly lnsrc):
       is to be called from the corresponding run directory to link
       the source code into the src subdirectory. It also links
       the getconf.csh, run.csh, and start.in files into the run
       directory. When done, go into src and say "make".

timestr: produces a time stamp; used by several scripts.

tst.csh: runs start.csh and run.csh, and puts the results
         directly into a TEST.* file, where the asterisk
         denotes a time stamp.

adapt-mkfile: used by Makefile

new: produces a new run directory similar to another one.
     Usage "new rings1 rings1b" for example, produces a new
     run directory rings1b. You still need to compile the code
     in the corresponding run directory.

cvsci_run: used to check in a standard set of file that are frequently
     used for post-processing purposes (including time_series.dat and index.pro)

In the mean time there are many more files now. New files tend to
be preceded by "pc_" to identify them as Pencil Code scripts.
