lnsrc: is to called from the corresponding run directory to link
       the source code into the src subdirectory. It also links
       the getconf.csh, run.csh, and start.in files into the run
       directory. When done, go into src and say "make".

timestr: produces a time stamp; used by several scripts.

tst.csh: runs start.csh and run.csh, and puts the results
         directly into a TEST.* file, where the asterisk
         denotes a time stamp.

adapt-mkfile: used by Makefile

new: produces a new run directory similar to another one.
     Usage "new rings1 rings1b" for example, produces a new
     run directory rings1b. You still need to compile the code
     in the corresponding run directory.
