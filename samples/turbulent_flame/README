Comments:
    Before running the main simulation three other simulations have
    to be performed in order to:
       1) Set up the initial 1D flame front
       2) Create the turbulence in the isotropic box
       3) Fill the domain with decaying turbulence from the isotropic box

    What should be done is therefore:
       1) Run the 1D initial condition setup (./init_cond_1D) in order
          to set up a good initial profile for the flame front. (This very
          run is run on only one processor and without MPI.) This takes
          typically 5 minutes. The results can be visualized in IDL by
          e.g. "temperature.pro" or "species.pro". The first script is run 
          by typing
          > .r temperature
          in the IDL prompt.
       2) Run the isotropic box (./turbulent_box) to be used as 
          inlet condition. This is done in typically half an hour.
          Since this is a 8 processor job (as all the remaining jobs)
          it should normally be submitted to the que of your cluster.
          See that it has reach statistically steady state by typing
          > .r ts
          in IDL.
       3) Run the 3D initial condition setup (./init_cond_3D) in order
          to fill the domain with turbulence before the flame is introduced.
          For visualizing e.g. the velocity in the y direction in a 2D
          slice in the xy plane you must first run
          > ./src/read_videofiles.x
          on the linux prompt. Answer 'uu2' on the query.
          Then open IDL and run the script "uy".
       4) Run the startscript of the main simulation. 
       5) When the startscript finalizes your should use pc_copyvar 
            > pc_copyvar var.dat var.dat ./init_cond_3D . -e
          in order to copy the 3D initial condition to the main simulation.
       6) Run the main simulation. Please remember that if you want to
          continue running the simulation even after it has finalized 
          once you must turn off the reinitialization of the chemistry
          in run.in. 
          E.g. the species can now be visualized by running
          > pc_visualize_species
          in IDL. (Remember to run ./src/read_videofiles.x on the
          linux prompt first.)
