UNDER DEVELOPMENT!!!


  FILES IN THIS PATH ARE ONLY DRAFTS FOR A NEW
  CONFIGURATION SYSTEM


  THERE ARE ALSO SOME PERL SCRIPTS IN THE ROOT
  AND DATA FILES ONLY TO BE USED FOR DEVELOPMENT
  OF THE CONFIGURATION SYSTEM

  ----------------------------------------
   Thoughts...
   
   What about just creating a link
   to the approptiate config directory
   when you do setup-src.
  ----------------------------------------

                    pencil-code/config/README
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains all the currently checked in configurations
for various platforms, operating systems and individual domains or 
hosts.

Because of the requirement of symbolic links it has been necessary 
to archive all this information into one tarball which can be 
maintained by CVS.  This may in future be automated using the 
cvswrapper/tar facility or similar.

At present a Makefile has been provided to allow you to unpack the 
latest tree or repackage it for resubmission to CVS.

To build the config tree simply change to this directory and type:

   make links

To add any new links to the archive and submit them to CVS simply
type:

   make commit

(your default editor will start, as set in the EDITOR environment
variable asking you to enter a message for the CVS log.)

                         Search order
-------------------------------------------------------------------

When looking for a partucular configuration file for particular 
machine the Pencil-Code routines will use 3 pieces of information:

 1) System type - <SYS>    (usually from 'uname -a')
 2) Hostname    - <HOST>   (usually from 'hostname' or 'uname -n')
 3) Domain name - <DOMAIN> (if available, usually 'hostname -d')

The first occurance of the required filename in the following list
will be used.  The rest of the files will not be read, though in
many cases like Makefiles it should be possible to explicitly
inherit/include settings from other files.  The search tree:

All paths are relative to $PENCIL_HOME/config/

A) Host specific:
     <SYS>/<DOMAIN>/<HOST>/
     <SYS>/<HOST>.<DOMAIN>/
     <SYS>/<HOST>/

B) Domain specific:
     <SYS>/<DOMAIN>/

C) System Specific
     <SYS>/

D) Generic 
     ./             (i.e. the $PENCIL_HOME/config/ )
