Trying to reproduce: Table 2, column 1, of BNPST90

Aspect ratio 3, density contrast 11.
Stratification: cs0=0.2887, rho0=1
Resolution: 150 x 51 (in the x and z directions).
Ra=1e5, Fbot=0.001375, nu=K=0.0011
typical timestep: 8.7e-3.

The actual run has been done in directory:
pencil-code/runs/slab_conv/Hurlburt84-Ra1e5
The run never became steady: the downdrafts keep
sweeping back and forth.
