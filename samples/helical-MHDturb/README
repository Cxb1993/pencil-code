This is a helical MHD turbulence run. After about 600 time units
a large scale magnetic field develops from an initially random
magnetic field (if initaa=0 is set). The set of forcing wavenumbers
are precalculated in idl (../idl/gwav.pro). In the B01 paper, the
average forcing wavenumber was 5. In the present sample file it is
set to about 3.
