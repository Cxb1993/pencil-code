About the meeting
-----------------

The "Pencil Code Meeting 2008" will take place August 19-22 2008 at the Sterrewacht Leiden in The Netherlands. The meeting is organised by Anders Johansen.

The Pencil Code (http://www.nordita.org/software/pencil-code/) is a
highly versatile and modular code for massively parallel computations. The
project is unique in the astrophysical community in that the code is
continuously developed by a number of independent researchers. The development
is kept in alignment through the use of a version control system (CVS) that
allows the developers to work on different aspects of the code, while still
working within a single branch. Automated nightly checks of a large number of
physical standard problems ensures that no new development will break the
code.

The Pencil Code Meeting is an annual meeting dedicated to the Pencil Code. The purpose of the meeting is to bring regular users and core developers together to discuss scientific and technical progress since the last meeting, to instigate collaborative projects and to allow new users to learn more about the code and to interact with other users and developers.

Budget
------

An estimated 10 of the 15 participants will be eligible for travel support, either because they hold junior positions (PhD students, young postdocs) or because they hold positions in institutions that are not able to provide travel support.

The estimated costs of the workshop are (in Euro):

  Travel        : 3000 (10 x 300)
  Accommodation : 3200 (10 x 4 x 80)
  Lunch         :  600 (15 x 4 x 10)
  Total         : 6800

Lunch would be provided for every participant, independently of whether they receive travel support.

Sterrewacht Leiden has kindly offered to provide a conference room for the entire duration of the workshop, free of charge.

Co-funding: NOVA will only provide part of the required funding. List the other
sources of funding that are already obtained or requested.  To provide a
guideline, the target of NOVA funding is of order 25-30% of the total costs
with an upper limit for the NOVA grant of kfl. 10. 

Funding requests will be submitted to the following organisations:

  * Astrosim (3800 Euro)

  * NOVA (1500 Euro)
