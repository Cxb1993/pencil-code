In this test we solve an ODE with the Pencil Code (hence 0-D).

    rho T ds/dt = heat_uniform

We have variable degree of hydrogen ionization, but Helium stays neutral.
Our units are [rho]=1e-6 g/cm^3, [u]=km/s, [x]=Mm, [T]=K.

idl.png shows the resulting temperature as a function of thermal energy.
This result is plotted using plot_result.csh

In order for the run not to last too long on slow machines, we have
changed the file run.in to run longer and fewer time steps. The original
file used for making the figure is still available as "run.in-fig.pTTss".
