1. Symptoms:

  The attached file seed.f90 prints the random number generator's seed,
  which should be nontrivial. But initially there are only zeros,which are
  replaced by other numbers only as random_number() is producing numbers.

2. Command sequence:

  unix>  make FC=ifc test
or
  fe4>  make FC=ifort80 NLSPATH=/usr/local/lib/intel/intel_fc_80/lib/ifcore_msg.cat test
(or similar)

3. Platforms:
   32-bit:

   Gentoo, Kernel 2.4.24, Intel Xeon, 2.4GHz
       ifc 7.1   Build 20040713Z

4. Other compilers tested (OK means problem could not be reproduced):
   - Intel ifc 6.0                 (x86 Linux)  OK
   - Intel ifc 7.0 Build 20021028Z (x8 Linux)   OK
   - Intel ifort 8.0 Build 20040616Z Package ID: l_fc_pc_8.0.046_pe049.1
                                                OK

5. Workaround:
   - Call random_number to produce at least 47 random numbers before
     working with seed
   - Don't multiply seed with processor number, replace it or add it

6. Comment:
   I am not sure this is a real bug; but it is definitively annoying.
   Doesn't seem to be a problem for the Pencil Code as far as I see.
