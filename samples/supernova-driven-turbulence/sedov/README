This simulation  is designed to verify the code reproduces the Sedov-Taylor solution 
for a single supernova remnant in a monotomic uniform ISM at rest. 
We use an ambient density of 1 atom per cm cubed. 
At this density the box needs to be over 170 parsecs in radius to permit the remnant 
shell to grow without reaching the boundary. 
Radiative cooling and uv-heating are neglected to produce purely adiabatic growth. 
Using density below 0.5 atoms would require a box of larger dimensions to track later growth of the remnant.
Injection of 10^51 ergs is achieved through 50% kinetic and 50% thermal energy.
