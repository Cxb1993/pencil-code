About the meeting
-----------------

The Pencil Code Meeting is an annual meeting dedicated to the Pencil
Code. The purpose of the meeting is to bring regular users and core
developers together to discuss scientific and technical progress since
the last meeting, to instigate collaborative projects and to allow new
users to learn more about the code and to interact with other users
and developers

Here are some topics that the meeting aims at covering:

  * Recent science results obtained with the Pencil Code
  * Technical issues, such as transition from CVS to SVN version
    control systems
  * Future improvements to the code
  * A Pencil Code paper
