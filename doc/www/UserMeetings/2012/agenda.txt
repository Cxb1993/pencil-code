New topics:

+ 6-page manual (Illa & Michiel)

+ anelastic module (Boris, Axel, Matthias)

+ Boussinesq (boundary conditions, chi-K bussinesq)

+ GUI (inspection)

+ CUDA (mn-loop)

+ Compound data

+ Simultaneous grid (Nils)

+ Testfield  (spherical)

+ common data module (for EOS, density, density)

+ subfolder

+ object-oriented

- diagnosing statistics: why increase > 2009.5 - 2011.0

- test (field) method in spherical geometry

- very few comments?? Need to find ohluh's email address

- to add to the manual instructions to enter info under people

- exporting diagnostics (not clear how)

- manual additions: vector visualization, queing system

- polar boundary conditions (status report: Dhruba not looked at for long time)
  -> Petri to say what does not work

- status of the energy (entropy) module

- still questions regarding the particle module, especially about
  collisions. More documentation seems to be desired.
    
- need for a table to identify who entered whom as project member
  ? or does this already exist under google wiki?/AB
  to continue!

- should we make cdt=0.9 the default?/AB
  * Done, but may need some documentation

- Should participation in mailing lists be mandatory?
  * Who is *not* on the list
  * Check who should be in the list, and send an email obliging them
    to be on the list. 
  * Remove spurious spammers that seem to have made to the list

- List in the webpage all papers that were published using Pencil. 
  *php script

- Quarterly Pencil Code progress meeting (Skype)
  Good for introducing new members, talking about plans, possibility
  for new developers to discuss their ideas with more experienced
  developers, ...
  * Try monthly, schedule in advance, say, last Tuesday of the month, 
    and let people organize themselves around it. 

       1:00 AM - California 
       4:00 PM - New York
      10:00 PM - Central Europe
      11:00 PM - Finland        

    Next meeting, 31 July, 10 pm, Tuesday.

    * Have a doodle, lime survey, or whatever online voting stuff
      in the pencil code page for voting

    + status and checks of the anelastic module

    + non-solar radiation transport
      * CK

  - Conservativeness.
    Need to check with Anders about status of WENO transport scheme
    (Not working yet in multiple-dimension, move to special module, 
    Given to Anders) 
    * Ask Anders if that is still an issue. 
      WENO works, shock tube tests. Still needs shock viscosity. 
      If someone wants to work with WENO, they can. 

  - cleaning up *.h files and check for breaks in modularity
    (Given to Axel)
    * They can be cleaned, for instance lnrho_bot, lnrho_top
    ss_bot, ss_top are only defined in gravity, then shared. They 
    shouldn't be in gravity. Also, qgshear, n_pot and r0_pot are 
    shared but used in gravity only. Think of an automated way 
    to capture all these. Check also politropic indices, in eos.h
      
  - advec_hyper3mesh_rho=diffrho_hyper3_mesh*pi5_1*dx_1(l1:l2) issue
    (cf. Wlad's email of 18 July 2011?)
    (Axel to work on this, nor done yet)

  - automated diagnostic
    (Axel: more important may now be to encapsulate 90% of the diagnostics
    to a module called magnetic/diagnostics_advanced.f90)
    * too many lines in the physics modules devoted to diagnostics! it may be
    possible to move them somewhere else?

  - some other point from Alex: to set diagnostics output in wall-clock times
    * idea: to have an output every, say, 10mn
    --> code idiag_something related to the it value (see L419 in run.f90)

  - check who is on which google email list
    http://groups.google.com/group/pencil-code-discuss/members
    * we already discussed about that

  - change the frequency of xyaverages through a new d1davg
    and allow the time units to be changed to wall-clock hours.
    (Axel to work on)

  - A common data file (like cdata.f90) to be shared between density,
    eos and entropy. We may call this cthermo.f90 (common thermodynamics).
    This may solve some problems with modularity of the code.  
    * Boris: is it really a good idea as we have now the put/getshared_variable 
    system? so why doing that just for thermo? AXEL: the shared_variable
    system is maybe too complicate for this stuff and a cthermo.f90 file can 
    be useful
    (?Wlad to work on this?)

  - nomodules compiles with syscalls instead of nosyscalls.... what is
    syscalls and what is it doing in the code? Add it to the manual.

  - Do the Athena's Double Mach Reflection

  - Code a routine to convert vector fields between geometries,
    spherical/cartesian/cylindrical

  - Write auxiliary variables to data/varname.dat. Maybe copy from index.pro?

  - Is parallel field line tracing of any interest? If so we can discuss about
    a more efficient implementation and additional features like integrating
    quantities along field lines.
    (SC)

  - Any attempts of improving visualization routines. Visualization during
    run time. GUIs by Miikka and Simon.

  - Visualization, GUIs, python: Illa, Miikka, Simon:
    Simon: - tools: animate_interactive, pc2vtk
           - paraview

- Next Pencil code meeting: Lund (Michiel)
- The idl directory (Michiel)
- Students starting out with the pencil code, what do you need and is
  everything in the manual (Michiel)
