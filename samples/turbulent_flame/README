Comments:
    Before running the main simulation three other simulations have
    to be performed in order to:
       1) Set up the initial 1D flame front
       2) Create the turbulence in the isotropic box
       3) Fill the domain with decaying turbulence from the isotropic box

    What should be done is therefore:
       1) Run the 1D initial condition setup (./init_cond_1D) in order
          to set up a good initial profile for the flame front. (This very
          run is run on only one processor and without MPI.) This takes
          typically 10-15 minutes.
       2) Run the isotropic box (./turbulent_box) to be used as 
          inlet condition.
       3) Run the 3D initial condition setup (./init_cond_3D) in order
          to fill the domain with turbulence before the flame is introduced.
       4) Use pc_copyvar 
            > pc_copyvar var.dat var.dat ./init_cond_3D . -e
          in order to copy the 3D initial condition to the main simulation.
       5) Run the main simulation.
