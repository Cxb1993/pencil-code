1. You are not supposed to compile in this src directory.

2. You should always compile from the run directory
   (e.g. creacted via pc_newrun by cloning an earlier run).
   This src directory appears then as a link in you run directory.
   The pc_setupsrc produces a file Makefile in your run directory.

3. The file src/Makefile.local indicates which files are actually used.
   In fact, only a small fraction is used each time.

4. Example: the equation-of-state module. You would only used one
   out of several possibilities:

     eos_idealgas.f90
     eos_chemistry.f90
     eos_ionization.f90
     eos_fixed_ionization.f90
     eos_temperature_ionization.f90

   and runs without an equation of state you would use:

     noeos.f90

5. Some confusion may occur because not all modules are equally
   frequently used, and some are more outdated and not recommended.
   The following gives a brief status decription.

Brief status description about some modules
===========================================

The EOS module
--------------

6-sep-09: For standard applications "eos_idealgas" is used routinely.
"eos_chemistry" is only used in conjunction with the chemistry module,
but chemistry.f90 can also be used with eos_idealgas.f90.
"eos_ionization" calculates the degree of ionization from the Saha equation,
"eos_fixed_ionization" is similar, but uses a fixed degree of ionization.

The testfield module
--------------------

None of these modules have to run with magnetic field, but they can
if one wants the velocity field to be affected by the magnetic field.

     testfield_z.f90

       6-sep-09: is used routinely. Assumes z-dependent mean magnetic fields.
    
     testfield.f90

       6-sep-09: is not currently used, but functional and would need to be
       checked and updated. It is used for testfields that depend on
       x and z, so avering over y is assumed.

     testfield_x.f90

       6-sep-09: is functional, but not at the same level of advancement as testfield_z.
       It is used for x-dependent mean fields, i.e. averaging over y and z is assumed.
       9-may-10: seems now to produce wrong results. Is not part of auto-test.

     testfield_xz.f90

       6-sep-09: status is currently unclear. It may be redundant.

     testfield_axisym.f90

       Uses 3 test fields and assumes test turbulence to have one
       preferred direction, so it is assumed to be axisymmetric.
       9-may-10: this routine works well for periodic test fields.
       This routine is now being superseeded by testfield_axisym2.

     testfield_axisym2.f90

       Uses 2 test fields and assumes test turbulence to have one
       preferred direction, so it is assumed to be axisymmetric.
       9-may-10: this routine works well for periodic test fields.
       Linear test fields have not been tested yet.
       This routine is cheaper to run than testfield_axisym and
       has been used in recent applications with Koen and Karl-Heinz.

     testfield_nonlin_z.f90

       This routine has been used in the 2010 paper with Rheinhardt.

     testfield_compress_z.f90

       Is not ready yet. It is supposed to extend testfield_nonlin_z
       into the case where u.gradu and gradh are included in the
       momentum equation.

The anelastic module
--------------------

The former anelastic branch is now inactive and all changes have been
merged into the main trunk.

     density_anelastic.f90

       26-dec-09: several aspects of this module are now working,
       but it is still experimental and should not be used for
       production runs.

The coagulation module
----------------------

This module is not currently used for production runs. 2 of 3 samples in 0D
work, but one requires the small pencil check to be turned off.
