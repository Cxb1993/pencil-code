In this test we solve an ODE with the Pencil Code (hence 0-D).

    rho T ds/dt = heat_uniform

We have variable degree of hydrogen ionization, but Helium stays neutral.
Our units are [rho]=1e-6 g/cm^3, [u]=km/s, [x]=Mm, [T]=K.

idl.png shows the resulting temperature as a function of thermal energy.
