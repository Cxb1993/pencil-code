In manual.tex we try to keep a reasonably up-to-date description of the code.
For latex installations that don't have some of the less frequent style files,
we keep a selection in the texinputs/ directory.

In DISCUSSION we find some of the items where possible changes are imminent.

In TESTS you find a selection of test results that have been checked in.
