List of suggested discussion topics:

Admin:
   Changing from CVS to another Versioning System **
   GPL agreement, going to version 3 **
   Multiauthor paper discussing methods and tests?
      good illustrative problems? (e.g. source terms)
   Do we need a better tracker against breaks of the auto-test?
   pencil_consistency_check: possible overcalculation... pencil del2a (17) **
     Suggestion: switch off by default, on nightly test machines activate
     through global options file:
     - pencil_consistency_check
     - color output
   Strange comments such as "life_support_off?" **
     WARNING: death on error restored occurred at life_support_off
     [Write Bugzilla report, assign to Anders]
   Configuration based on machine multiple names **
     Host name could be set in global .pencil/ directory.

Clean-up:
   A clean up of the IDL directory? **
     Make obsolete directory in $PENCIL_HOME/idl and move all files there.
     Make descriptive subdirectories of $PENCIL_HOME/idl and move useful files
     there.
     Suggested subroutines read, write, plot, calc.
   State of the manual. What needs to be done?
     more about boundary conditions (to be done) **
     Manual and Wiki: wiki for not so well established stuff **
     Suggestion: add more formulas (derivations and ``how do we get there'')
     Suggestion: equation of state should come before passive scalar, etc.

Technical additions:
   Spherical and cylindrical coordinates
   Upwinding stuff in non-cartesian coordinates: **
     Suggestion: treat partial derivative with upwinding
   Non-reflecting open b.c.s (Wolfgang) **
=> Density floors and ceilings
=> Radiation transport in shearing boxes
   The shock viscosity (Tobi and Anders)
   Isolated boundary conditions (Chao-Chin Yang)
     James, R.A. 1977, J. Comp. Phys. 25, 71-92.

Next meeting? Where? Elsewhere than Stockholm? How to do it differently?
Tentative time: 26-29 Aug 2008.

Yes. Possibly Leiden.
