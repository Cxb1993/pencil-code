This directory contains idl routines that can be used with VAPOR.
See http://www.vapor.ucar.edu/ for VAPOR documentation.

"pc_write_vapor.pro" is an IDL routine that converts a Pencil varfile set to
a VAPOR VDF file, so that the VAPOR tools can then be applied to the data.

Getting Started
---------------
1)
You need to install VAPOR first:

   http://www.vapor.ucar.edu/

Download it and run vaporinstall.sh, I installed in /opt/vapor.
Make sure you have /your/install/path/vapor/lib in both
LD_LIBRARY_PATH and IDL_DLM_PATH, e.g. for a 'sh' or 'bash' shell:
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/vapor/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
    export IDL_DLM_PATH="/opt/vapor/lib:$IDL_DLM_PATH"
or for a 'csh'-compatible shell:
    setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "/opt/vapor/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
    setenv IDL_DLM_PATH "/opt/vapor/lib:$IDL_DLM_PATH"
before starting IDL.

2)
To generate a VDF-file (default: data/var.vdf) just run "pc_write_vapor"!
This should write all the variables from varfile.

You can add options like the pc_read_var command, e.g.:
   variables=['lnrho','ss']
or
   variables=['rho','tt'], /magic

You can specify an input varfile:
   varfile='VAR20'
or
   varfile='VAR',ivar=20

Or you can convert a sequence of files:
   varfile='VAR', ivarmin=1, ivarmax=20
You can also specify an alternative VDF output file:
   vdffile='mydata.vdf'

Be aware that this ALWAYS trims the ghost zones off the data!
More parameters are listed in the header of "pc_write_vapor.pro".

3)
Then run "vaporgui" with the same environment variables set.

4)
Go to the "data" menu and click "Load data into the current session".
(You can do this while IDL still writes the remaining data for a sequence!)

5)
Play! E.g., go to the "DVR" tab (volume rendering), select a variable,
enable rendering, and adjust the opacity.

Note:
If you put multiple varfiles into one VAPOR VDF file,
you can not switch to the animation tab and hit play.
For that, you need to store each varfile in separate VDF files.


Original Instructions
---------------------

In a VAPOR IDL session run "pc_write_vapor" with the following arguments:
the absolute path to the root of the pencil data,
the number of processors used to create the pencil data,
the absolute path to the vdf file (created in step 1),
the timestep being converted optionally, and
the name of the var files (if it is not "var", as in "var.dat").
