This simulation uses the injection of kinetic and thermal energy into a realistic
 galactic profile derived from Katia Ferriere's gravity scheme.
An initial density(z) profile is chosen to approximate isothermal hydrostatic equilibrium.
The weak azimuthal seed field (peak 1.7724e-8 Gauss) is directly proportional to the
gas density.
The model includes radiative cooling, uv heating and shock viscosity is included to smooth
shock variables for numerical handling. This requires high resolution and MPI.
