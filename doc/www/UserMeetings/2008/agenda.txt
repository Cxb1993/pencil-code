Todo topics
  turning off the lpencil_check in auto-test
  writing of timings
  ordering T-shirts in good time
  change to SVN some time before the meeting
  clean up and re-order IDL directory

Discussion topics

- Intro to using python instead of idl (at least for newcomers) [Boris]

- Cleaning up the Makefile [Boris]

- An experience database [Anders]

- A discussion about Anders' problem regarding the conservation of mass in the
code. For quite high compressible convection runs (both in local boxes and
star-in-a-box ones), I also experienced bad mass conservation when
applying the upwind scheme on lnrho and this discussion will certainly be
useful for everybody (as Wolfgang's remarks following Anders' first
email). [Boris]

- A discussion about what the canonical list of tests would be. Actually,
we check 30 tests while some tests share the same physics (e.g. the
different convection ones). One can ask the question to restrict tests to
really different physics and/or geometry. [Boris]

- Discuss the future of initial conditions. The code is loaded with useless
and obsolete initial conditions. Should we put those in a special
initcond_XXX extension of each module?

- Should we add gsl library to the pencil code source?

- Is there a good way to avoid wrong names such as lncc for cc and lnTT for TT?

- Help with VAPOR

+ remove all lbidiagonal_derij=F
