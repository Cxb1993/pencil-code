Comments:
    MRI-active globaldisk in cartesian coordinates with dust particles
    Used in Lyra et al. 2007	

    When using it for production runs, remember to change format "F" to "E" 
    in the stresses. The initial stresses are too near machine precision to 
    figure in the auto-test, hence the "F" format and the absense of the 
    Maxwell stress brbpm in the print.in of this sample.
