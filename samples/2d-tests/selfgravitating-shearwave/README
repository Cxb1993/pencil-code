Comments:
    Linear test problem for self-gravity in the shearing sheet. A leading shear
    wave is swung around by the Keplerian shear and amplified by self-gravity.
    One can compare the numerical solution to the result of a numerical
    integration of the linearised equation system, produced by the IDL script
    shear_wave.pro (in the idl/ directory).
