Modular pencil code.

Not yet reasonably implemented. Basic idea is as follows:

You decide to use, or not use, modules by including them or the `no-'
versions in the makefile. E.g. to use MPI communication, you put 
  MPICOMM=mpicomm
into Makefile, while in order to not use MPI, you do
  MPICOMM=nompicomm

List of alternatives (not all of them implemented yet):

  mpicomm   nompicomm
  forcing   noforcing
  magnetic  nomagnetic
  entropy   noentropy
  io-multi io-mono io-hdf5         # write to per-process file, use one
                                   # monolithic file, or use hdf5


The physics modules (those involving new variables like `magnetic' or
`entropy'; in principle, there should also be a hydro module) *register*
themselves via calls to their their `register_xxx' from the module
`register'. They also provide their own initialisation (`init_ent',
etc.) for start.f90.

The physics modules require that you correctly adapt mvar (and other
parameters?) in cparam.dat. If you forget to do so, you will get a warning
-- or possibly a compilation error.
