Status:
    succeeds # One of [succeeds|failing since <date>|obsolete| ...]
Recommended resolution:
    None. Going to lower resolution would be a good test of how many grid
    points the code needs to resolve a self-gravitating shear wave.
Comments:
    Another shear wave test, this time without gravity but with drag force, used to
    test drag force assignment over the shear-periodic boundary.
