This directory contains a sample of "initial condition" files that deal with
custom initial conditions. It allows a user to implement his/her initial 
condition, without overload for other users. 

The best way to start a new initial condition module is to go to 
pencil-code/src/ and copy noinitial_condition.f90 to 
initial_condition/NewInitialCondition.f90 and start editing
NewInitialCondition.f90 for your purposes. This approach is better 
than modifying an existing initial condition file, because they tend 
to be too specialized! The noinitial_condition.f90 module also contains 
lots of comments.

Example:
  cp noinitial_condition.f90 initial_condition/star_in_a_box.f90

However, looking for example also at initial_condition/mhs_equilibrium.f90 
might indeed be a good idea.
