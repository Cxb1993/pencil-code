This directory contains a sample of "special" files that deal with
specialized applications. It allows the user to do completely new things
with the code that have nothing to do with hydro or MHD, for example.

The best way to start a new special module is to go to pencil-code/src/
and copy nospecial.f90 to special/NewSpecialModule.f90 and start editing
NewSpecialModule.f90 for your purposes. This approach is better than
modifying an existing special module, because the tend to be too specialized!
The nospecial.f90 module also contains lots of comments.

Example:
  cp nospecial.f90 special/oscillation_0D.f90

However, looking for example also at special/lorenz_gauge.f90 might indeed
be a good idea.
