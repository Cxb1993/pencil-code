 Crayon, for those not familiar with the concept, is a
 Lite version of the Pencil code. Its purpose is mainly
 educational, but also to allow new users to get the
 "feeling" of the code before embarking on the task
 of programming the main code.

 Crayon will be kept out of the sync of the repository, and
 perhaps incorporate just major changes (something similar to
 the pencil case of years ago).

 The pencil check is still complaining (though no-modules pass the
 test). The relevant bin commands only change "pc" for "cr". So, the
 setup is

   cr_setupsrc

 Users are welcome to take a look and comment on what they like/dislike. 
 This version (July 2010) is not yet a last version, and input will be 
 highly welcomed.
