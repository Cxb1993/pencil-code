1. You are not supposed to compile in this src directory.

2. You should always compile from the run directory
   (e.g. creacted via pc_newrun by cloning an earlier run).
   This src directory appears then as a link in you run directory.
   The cr_setupsrc produces a file Makefile in your run directory.

3. The file src/Makefile.local indicates which files are actually used.
   In fact, only a small fraction is used each time.

4. Example: the equation-of-state module. In Pencil you would only used one
   out of several possibilities:

     eos_idealgas.f90
     eos_chemistry.f90
     eos_ionization.f90
     eos_fixed_ionization.f90
     eos_temperature_ionization.f90

   and runs without an equation of state you would use:

     noeos.f90

5. Some confusion may occur because not all modules are equally
   frequently used, and some are more outdated and not recommended.
   The following gives a brief status decription.
