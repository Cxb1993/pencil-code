This directory contains the python subroutines for postprocessing.
sourceme.sh now resents your $PYTHONPATH to include $PENCIL_HOME/python,
so you can just do

import pencil as pc

in your script or from your favorite python shell (ipython is a good one). 

Once you've done so, 

var = pc.read_var(datadir='data/')

returns an object with the entire f array as well as some handy constants. 

Note that because python is C-indexed instead of fortran-indexed, and
matplotlib assumes [y,x] ordering for 2D plotting, the f array returned is in
the opposite order from how it is in pencil: var.f.shape will return
(nvar,nz,ny,nx).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To start rapidly under Python:

1. you must install the matplotlib library (a package often called
   python-matplotlib)
2. normally, numpy is installed as a dependency
3. the PYTHONPATH is initialised when sourcing 'sourceme.*'
4. for us, the best practical way to use Python is to start the ipython
   shell so its installation is a good idea
5. you must load all of the Python pencil modules using 'import pencil
   as pc'
6. you run a module using 'pc.read_ts()' and so on...
