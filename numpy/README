This directory contains a sole subdirectory, pencil. sourceme.sh now resents
your $PYTHONPATH to include $PENCIL_HOME/numpy, so you can just do

import pencil as pc

in your script or from your favorite python shell (ipython is a good one). 

Once you've done so, 

var = pc.read_var(datadir='data/')

returns an object with the entire f array as well as some handy constants. 

Note that because python is C-indexed instead of fortran-indexed, and
matplotlib assumes [y,x] ordering for 2D plotting, the f array returned is in
the opposite order from how it is in pencil: var.f.shape will return
(nvar,nz,ny,nx).
