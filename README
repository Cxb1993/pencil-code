Modular pencil code.

Basic idea is as follows:

You decide to use, or not use, modules by including them or the `no-'
versions in the makefile. E.g. to use MPI communication, you put 
  MPICOMM=mpicomm
into Makefile, while in order to not use MPI, you do
  MPICOMM=nompicomm

List of alternatives (not all of them implemented yet):

  mpicomm   nompicomm
  forcing   noforcing
  magnetic  nomagnetic
  entropy   noentropy
  density   nodensity
  hydro     nohydro  
  io-multi io-mono io-hdf5         # write to per-process file, use one
                                   # monolithic file, or use hdf5


The physics modules (those involving new variables like `hydro', `magnetic' or
`entropy') *register* themselves via calls to their their `register_xxx'
from the module `register'. They also provide their own initialisation
(`init_ent', etc.) for start.f90.
