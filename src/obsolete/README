Here we store routines that are not to be used, but we keep
them here in this location for some time just in case something
useful was in them after all.

nohydro_old.f90 is an old version and contains the possibility of
of kinematic flows. It is now no longer necessary.

magnetic_old.f90 still contains the mean-field stuff that is now
moved to magnetic/meanfield.f90. However, because of some differences
between the latest version, I keep this one still in place.
