In manual.tex we try to keep a reasonably up-to-date description of the code.
For latex installations that don't have some of the less frequent style files,
we keep a selection in the texinputs/ directory. If you use the makefile to
process manual.tex, you will automatically have that directory included in
you TeX path.

In DISCUSSION we find some of the items where possible changes are imminent.

In TESTS you find a selection of test results that have been checked in.
