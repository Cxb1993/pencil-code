Comments:
    Use as many physics modules as possible; together with samples/no-modules,
    this constitutes the minimal set of auto-tests.

    The ultimate auto-test: Evolves chiral passive scalars with the occasional
    supernova explosion in the planetary dust, and of course all of this with
    mean-field MHD, radiative transfer and self-gravity.
    It took some time to tune this such that it passes one Euler step at
    dt=1e-20. A time step of 1e-19 is already way too large...

    This now works, but with lots of smaller changes to the code that will get
    checked in next. Expect the next ~ 10 commits to contain questions like
    `Anders, is this OK?', `Tony, please check', etc.

    This test complements the no-modules test, but the two don't cover all
    modules we have. The next thing to do is to create a coverage report and
    check which important .f90 files are still missing. Then we can add
    `some-modules-1' and maybe `some-modules-2' to have a close-to-complete
    set of four tests.
