- Allow a subset of F2003 for specific modules, so that we can read namelists
  from internal files (buffered in memory). This will help to minimize the
  syscalls module and to get simple and robust IO on large amounts of CPUs.
  (Subsequently fake_/true_parallel_* functions can be removed.)

- Remove all hardcoded file units:
  Some compilers (e.g. ftn) complain about unit<=6 used for file-IO.
  [Philippe]

- Remove all hardcoded string lengths, there are pre-defined constants,
  e.g. for labels, boundary conditions, filenames, etc.
  [Philippe]

- Add missing content for "/doc/www/samples/" and "/doc/www/highlights/".
