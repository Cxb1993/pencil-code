Modular pencil code.

Not yet reaonably implemented. Basic idea is as follows:

You decide to use, or not use, modules by including them or the `no-'
versions in the makefile. E.g. to use MPI communication, you put 
  MPICOMM=mpicomm
inte Makefile, while in order to not use MPI, you do
  MPICOMM=nompicomm

List of alternatives (not all of them implemented yet):

  mpicomm   nompicomm
  forcing   noforcing
  magnetic  nomagnetic
  entropy   noentropy
  io-multi io-mono io-hdf5         # write to per-process file, use one
                                   # monolithic file, or use hdf5

Some modules (like `magnetic' or `entropy' require that you correctly
adapt mvar (and other parameters?) in cparam.dat. If you forget to do so,
you will get a warning -- or possibly a compilation error.
