$Id$

In this directory, the number in the file validated.dat
gives the revision number of the last successful auto-test
that was run by a user authorized to reset validated.dat.

For authorized users, the auto-test script writes the date of
each auto-test together with the previous revision number into
a machine-specific file, e.g. norosx52.albanova.se.auto-test.
